# Nerves of Steel (modified from Timer program)
###  MGTC28 Python exercise 3
This is a timer program written in Python  

![Nerves of Steel~](https://media.makeameme.org/created/do-you-have-3decfb9715.jpg)\
timer.py is a simple Python script that is modified for use in the 'Nerves of Steel' game. <br />

The program will show a message at the start to tell players to stand. <br />
Then it will generate a random time between 5 to 25 seconds to put the program to sleep. <br />
Upon timer expiry, the user will see "Time Up. Last to sit down wins." <br />

timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **random library** to generate a random time to put the program to sleep. <br />

Please see the documentation for the library used:
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
- [random](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules/random)
